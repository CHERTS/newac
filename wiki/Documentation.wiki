= Get It While It's Hot =

You can always get the latest version of the documentation hot off the presses at http://newac.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bin/newac_docs.rar. This link reaches right into the Subversion repository and digs out the very latest version of the documentation. 

== How to Read ==
No, not Hooked on Phonics, just a word on the file formats used. The wordy bits are all available in text files, but for code comments you'll have to view the index.html. Just open .\html\index.html with whatever browser you have. 


== How to Feel Cool (hint: don't use Internet Exploder) ==
If you're cool enough to have Opera 9.5b you'll get some nice text shadows (oooh.. ahh...). Firefox users aren't left out, they get a smattering of rounded corners courtesy of the default NaturalDocs CSS. Internet Explorer users will get perfectly working documentation, but no fancy stuff. This is because you suck at life, but you probably already knew that.
